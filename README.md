### Project Overview

 Haptik is one of the world's largest conversational AI platforms. It is a personal assistant mobile app, powered by a combination of artificial intelligence and human assistance. It has its domain in multiple fields including customer support, feedback, order status and live chat.

We have with us the dataset of Haptik containing the messages it receives from the customers and which topic(class) the messages refer to.

We need to create a model predicting which class a particular message belongs to using NLP. Use techniques like LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis) and LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to assign topics to new messages.


### Learnings from the project

 Topics reinforced while solving the project:


- [ ]     Text preprocessing techniques like tokenization & vectorization.
- [ ]     Implementation of Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and Linear SVM.
- [ ]     Topic modelling with LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis) and LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
- [ ]     Usage of coherence score to determine the optimum number of topics


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Steps Involved:

1. Data cleaning & preprocessing
2. Classification implementation - apply Logistic Regression , Naive Bayes and Lienar SVM model onto the data.
3. Apply Topic Modeling.
4. Create a model attaining to the optimum no. of topics
